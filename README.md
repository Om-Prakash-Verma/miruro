git clone https://github.com/Miruro-no-kuon/Miruro.git
```

```bash
cd Miruro
```

### 2. Installation

### Basic Pre-Requisites

> [!TIP]
> This platform is built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and utilizes [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to ensure the quickest response times achievable. While `npm` can also be used, the commands for npm would mirror those of Bun, simply substituting the specific commands accordingly.

> Bun is now available on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**. Below are the installation commands for each operating system.

### Install Bun

- Linux & macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

- Windows

```powershell
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Verify installations

- Check that both Node.js and Bun are correctly installed by running.

```bash
node -v
bun -v
```

### Install Dependencies

- You can use Bun to install dependencies quickly. If you prefer, `npm` can also be used with equivalent commands.

```bash
bun install
```

### Copy `.env.example` into `.env.local` in the root folder

- `.env.local` & `.env` are both viable options, you can also set
  `.env.test.local`,
  `.env.development.local` or
  `.env.production.local`

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### 3. Run on development &/or production (npm also works)

- Run on development mode

```bash
bun run dev
```

- Run on production mode

```bash
bun start
```
